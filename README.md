This is the second to last tutorial I plan to use before starting on my personal project. 
This one is by CodeCommerce whose tutorials I like.  
This particular todo app uses both tailwind and will use a database which is more practice I need.

The tutorial is found here:

update:
I will be back to figure out this one. I went through it hastily. I am going to start from scratch on the tutorial and see if that works.

update 2: 
did not need to redo tutorial, I had forgotten that I need to stop running the app and then do npm start again after install of tailwind

update 3:
tutorial is completed. This might be my favorite one. I did start skiing over my tips when I initially started with trying to put the keys in a .env file. However he does have a follow up video which I am going to watch that shows how to do it so I can figure out my mistakes.
